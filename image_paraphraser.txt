title:  Image Paraphraser?
---

Premise: can you use a generative image model to paraphrase a caption?

There are many approaches to paraphrasing, but with the rise of text to image models, I was curious if these models could be used as a paraphraser.

Models: I used 2 existing models.
1. DeepAI's text2img API [https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img). This model takes a caption as an input and generates 4 images based on the caption
2. Show and Tell neural image captioner ([Vinyals et al 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf))

Process
1. Input a caption
2. Generate images
4. Generate a caption for the image
5. Generate a new image based off the "paraphrased" caption
6. Generate a final caption for the new image

Example Results




Observations
The image model outperforms the relatively simple caption model. This model also wasn't trained on creative generated images, so it is less nuanced than the image generator.
It would be fun as a next step to train a caption model on generated images.
